# Automated Heated Pet Shelter #
This project is the software to control a heated pet shelter for my cat.

It uses an Uno, a couple of tempearture sensors, a load cell and amplifier, and a relay to activate a heating pad in the bottom of the shelter.

It uses the MyDelay Arduino library found [here](https://github.com/mggates39/MyDelay) on GitHub
